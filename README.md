# Weather App
#### Prod Branch - repo contains pub/build folder
A (VERY) rough Nodejs version of  [Switch Doc Labs's](https://github.com/switchdoclabs/OurWeatherWeatherPlus) api. essential an app to poll the station at regular intervals and log the data to a mysql database. I've never tried implementing the one from Switch Doc, so I can't really compare them, apples to apples... But I think this gets the trick done and maybe a few environmental specific changes.

First, install our packages...

`$ npm install`

Then to start server...

`$ npm start`

I'm also concurrently working on the [MySql branch](https://github.com/zerosquadron/weatherApp/tree/mysql) and am hoping to have a [Mongo branch](https://github.com/zerosquadron/weatherApp/tree/mongodb) started soon.
