# Weather App
a simple node app using <DB> to store weather data from my ourWeather Station picked up from [Switch Doc Labs](https://github.com/switchdoclabs/OurWeatherWeatherPlus)

First, install our packages...

`$ npm install`

You'll also need to set up [MySql](https://www.mysql.com/), or something similar. I've included the packages for `node-mysql` and `mysql` in the **with-Mysql** branch...

Then to start server...

`$ npm start`

Currently it's only logging to the console and serving a simple page. but it's coming along. working on getting db connections working.
